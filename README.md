# Serverless Framework Python Flask API on AWS

This is my first attempt at making a Flask API on AWS with Serverless

### requirements

You'll need to add a `vars.yml` file that contains values for the variables:
- bucket_data ( for image file storage )
- bucket_serverless ( for serverless file storage )
